====================================
I use $ to denote command
====================================
1. I use emacs to maintain the hw4.txt file
     $ emacs hw4.txt

2. I use git checkout with -b option to checkout 3.0 version
   into a new branch
     $ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. I install my patch by running patch command
     $ patch -p1 <~/quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. I read through the webpage to learn how to use the Emacs function
   add-change-log-entry-other-window

5. I run the git status to get the name of the files that I need to
   add log entry. I open the six files with emacs and use the function
   described before to add entries.
     $ git status
   The output is:
...
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c
...
   Then I do the following steps for each file
   i.e. for src/cmp.c
   	$ emacs src/cmp.c
	$ C-x 4 a
	type in: quote like 'this' or "this" but not `this`,
	change the quote from grave accents to single quote
     For this part the ChangeLog is like:
     	      * src/cmp.c: quote like 'this' or "this" but not `this`,
	      change the quote from grave accents to single quote
     For the rest five files, the steps are the same except the filename

6. I commit the change with git add and git commit 
       $ git add .
       $ git commit -F ChangeLog

7. I create the patch by using git format-patch
       $ git format-patch -1 --stdout >./formatted-patch.txt 


8. My partner is Shiqi Wang, her UID is 304582601
   I checkout v3.0 again to a new branch named "temp", using git am to
   apply the patch and run the process as described in README-hacking
   after apply the extra patch
   	 $ git checkout v3.0 -b temp
	 $ ./bootstrap
	 $ patch -p0 <p1
	 $ ./configure
	 $ make
	 $ make check

  There're errors of make check but piazza says just ignore it

9. After running make distdir, I check the ChangeLog and it has been modified
   as listed above
      	  $ make distdir
	
10. I log in the seasnet server01 with -X option. I use git clone to get the
    repository and run gitk.	  
    	  $ ssh -X classbwu@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu
	  $ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
	  $ cd emacs
	  $ gitk
    The detail of the following operation is recorded in gitk-screenshot.png
    and gitk-description.txt
