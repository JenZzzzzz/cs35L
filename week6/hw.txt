1.
   For the first part of the question, the answer is Yes. Although others could
   observe all the bytes, the bytes are already encrypted so that they won't
   be able to understand the content. Thus, the resulting network is still
   secure.

   1)The resulting network might be insecure because if the others could
   inspect every keystrokes of the team, they'll know the username and password
   one created for authentication. They then could ssh into the server without
   being suspected. Furthermore, they will know the passphrase
   to decrypt the private key so that if they could gain obtain the private
   key, they will be able to decrypt it and therefore read and modify files
   without restrictions.

   2)The resulting network is insecure because others will be able to
   obtain the generated keys, and thus they are able to decrypt the content
   of files when observing all bytes.

2. The gpg --verify command only show the signatrue information, since the
   information is determined only by the creator, everyone could use
   fake information. Thus,  the gpg --verigy command won't be able to know
   who really creates the file but simply take the input information.

   A solution to this problem might be to meet someone in person in order to
   give/get the public key. 
   Or we could use a third party CA which can for sure verify the identity of
   the file creator.
