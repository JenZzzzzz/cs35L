=================================
I use $ to denote command line
================================
My partner is: 
Name: Shiqi Wang
UID: 304582601

1. I run
     $ifconfig
  to get my address 10.97.85.188

2. To check the lab environment, I run $dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

It outputs:
   openssh-client     install

   It turns out that in the lab computer we already have openssh-client, but 
not the openssh-server
    so I run $sudo apt-get install openssh-server to get the openssh-server
And after that I run $dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

It outputs:
   openssh-client     install
   openssh-server     install

3. Firstly I act as the client

   1) I use $ssh-keygen to generate public and private keys
      Then it prompts for the position to store the key, I store it to the
      default ~/.ssh/is_rsa as required. I use 123456 as my passphrase.

   2) My partner use 'aaa' as the username for me, her address is 10.97.85.170
      So I then run
      	 $ ssh-copy-id –i aaa@10.97.85.170
      And is asked for confirmation since it's the first time I connect to this
      server. Then I am prompted for the password required by the server, which
      is created by my partner as '12345'

   3) Then I run $ ssh-add to add private key to authenticate agent (ssh-agent)

   4) Then I run ssh with -X option
      	   $ ssh -X aaa@10.97.85.170

      To make usre I have successfully connected to the server (my partner's
      PC), I create a test file.
      	   $ touch testfile

      And when she run $ls on her terminal, she is able to see the file,
      so it works.

   5) At last I run several commands like $ xterm(which opens a terminal 
   window), $ gedit, $ firefox as described in the spec.

   6) I run $ exit and then  $ ssh -X aaa@10.97.85.170 again to connect 
      the server. It no longer prompts for password anymore.

4. Then I act as the server.

   1) Since I've already created the public-private keypair as the client, I
      do not need to recreate it.

   2) I create an account for the client on the server
      	$ sudo useradd -d /home/bbb -m bbb

      Then I create the password for that username
      	$ sudo passwd bbb
      I am prompted for the password and I use '654321' as the password, then I
      am prompted to re-type the password.

    3) I create .ssh directory for new user
       $ cd /home/bbb
       $ sudo mkdir .ssh

    4) I change ownership and permission on .ssh
       $ sudo chown –R username .ssh
       $ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

    5) After my partner create the testfile as the process described
       in my step 3., I could also see the testfile under the directory
       I created for her, which demonstrates she has successfully ssh
       into me as a client.
