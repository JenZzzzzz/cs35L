For the two C pograms, the details are in tr2b.c and tr2u.c

matches, or output the original one if it doesn't.

The difference between the two programs is, I use system call

strace -o bufOutputCopy.txt ./tr2b abc xyz < test.txt > testResult.txt
wc -l bufOutputCopy.txt
58 bufOutputCopy.txt


strace -o unbufOutputCopy.txt ./tr2u abc xyz < test.txt > testResult.txt
$ wc -l unbufOutputCopy.txt 
10485813 unbufOutputCopy.txt
